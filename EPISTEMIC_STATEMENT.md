Epistemic Statement

This project employs an automated, AI-assisted research pipeline.
Automation is used exclusively for mechanical, procedural, and consistency-related tasks.

All epistemic responsibility remains with the human investigator.

Specifically:
- Automation governs execution, validation, and reproducibility.
- Epistemic commitments, interpretations, and framing decisions are human responsibilities.
- No automated component is authorized to introduce, modify, or justify conceptual assumptions.

Quality control gates serve as consistency and rigor filters.
Passing a QC gate does not imply scientific truth, correctness, or causal validity.

The system is designed to reduce untracked judgment calls, not to eliminate human judgment.
