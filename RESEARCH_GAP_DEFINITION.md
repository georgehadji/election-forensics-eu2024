Definition of Research Gap

In this project, a research gap is defined as a demonstrable limitation in existing election forensics methods,
empirical coverage, or validation practices that satisfies all of the following conditions.

A valid research gap must:

1. Be methodologically grounded.
   The gap must arise from identifiable assumptions, limitations, or failure modes
   in existing methods, not from absence of results alone.

2. Be empirically addressable.
   There must exist at least one feasible empirical or computational procedure
   capable of probing the gap using available or realistically obtainable data.

3. Be falsifiable or stress-testable.
   The proposed gap must allow for outcomes that could weaken or invalidate
   the proposed contribution.

4. Be independent of political interpretation.
   The gap must concern statistical or methodological properties,
   not normative, legal, or political claims.

5. Survive baseline comparison.
   The gap must persist after comparison with:
   - prior national elections,
   - prior European elections,
   - cross-country normalized baselines where applicable.

What does NOT constitute a research gap:

- Mere detection of anomalies without methodological novelty.
- Re-labeling known tests or metrics without substantive extension.
- Gaps defined solely by disagreement between polls and outcomes.
- Gaps that depend on unverifiable intent or institutional speculation.
- Country-specific irregularities without generalizable methodological insight.

A valid outcome of the automated gap generation phase is the identification of zero research gaps.
This outcome indicates sufficient coverage and adequacy of existing methods within the defined scope.
